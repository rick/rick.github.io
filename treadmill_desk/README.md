## Now I have a treadmill desk!

I've been travelling a lot over the past few years, and, while I've got more travel ahead of me, 
I'm spending the summer almost entirely at home.  I'm likely, starting this fall, to be at home a lot more.
I also work from home when I'm here, and I want to make my home/work life as nice as possible.

One thing I've noticed about travelling is, no matter how much I'm eating when I'm abroad, I almost
always lose weight by the time I get home.  When I'm home I almost always slowly gain weight back.
While I'm pretty sure the industrial food system in :us: is partly to blame, my exercise patterns 
account for as much or more of the phenomonen:  When I'm abroad I'm almost always walking or hiking
all day, sometimes with a backpack on my back.

I used to bike a lot at home, but my bike got stolen
and I've yet to replace it.  I love to walk and hike, but, even though I live near downtown in Nashville, 
I found myself realizing that there's very little in town that I actually want to walk to.  I'd almost rather
stay at home.  If I go hiking it's a conscious effort to drive somewhere where I can hike for a few miles and then 
drive back.  As the weather gets hotter (and it gets pretty sticky here in the summer), if I don't get up and get 
out walking or hiking by 7am or so, it's going to be annoyingly sticky by the time I get back.

The net effect is that I find myself walking less and staying home working more.  I've used a standing desk for
a while, as sitting seems to be really toxic, but I'm still not getting as much exercise as I do when I'm 
travelling.

So, I did some research on treadmill desks -- desks, usually with motorized or manual height adjustment, that have 
a treadmill underneath.  Many of them just take a plain treadmill, with big arms and consoles, and stick some wood or
shelves on top, and call that a desk.  **Not really attractive, and, well, that matters to me:**

Others come ready-made with $800-$1200 treadmills, coupled with specialized desks (or whose builders recommend
buying desks separately), some of the desks being $1000-$2500 themselves.  This seems like a bit much to me, 
especially since I don't know if the setups would actually work for me.  What if I'm just lazy, and I end up
wasting $3500 on something that my fat ass is just tripping over on a daily basis?

#### DIY, fashionably, without breaking the bank

So, I dug around some more and found the bits and pieces to put together something workable myself for a lot 
cheaper than some of the high-end setups, and that might actually look reasonable in my office.  Here's what I ended up with:

I found a number of standard treadmills, on the cheaper end of the spectrum.  Some of
them had low horsepower, or small tread decks, or documented annoying interfaces / beeps / smoking problems (what could go
wrong?) :fire: :skull: :fire:  I ended up finding a model that looked reasonable, found a PDF of the manual online and verified that I
could probably dismantle the arm handles from it and still keep it working, and then priced it out.  It ended up that
it was in the $450 range if I were to order it from Amazon, but it was in the $275 range if I ordered it from Wal-Mart 
and picked it up at the store nearest my parents (whom I was visiting last weekend anyway).  So I went that route.

For the standing desk, I found an adjustable desk frame, i.e., with no actual desktop, and with a manual adjustment -- that is, a hand
crank instead of an electric motor and switches.  I could get that frame through Amazon, delivered, and it wouldn't break 
the bank.  I've never liked any of the desktops that I've seen with adjustable desks (they're all too Office Space for me),
so this was actually a plus to me.  Certainly I could find a top that I liked and just put it on myself and save a little money.

Finally, I did just that.  We have a Habitat for Humanity "ReStore" in town that sells used building supplies.  I popped
in there yesterday and looked around.  Leaning against some shelves was a black IKEA "door", or countertop or something (well, 
it was labelled as a door, but no hinges, doorknob, knob holes, handles, etc.) that was priced at $45.  But it was marked
down to $22.  I grabbed that, checked out for $24 (incl. tax), and tried to fit it in my car (seriously, I've gotten some
big stuff in there, surprisingly -- including the treadmill!).  Wasn't going to happen: it was just too big.  I looked up and a friend was driving by
in a truck with an empty trailer (no joke) and helped me out.  Crazy.

The specifics:

 * [Adjustable Height Desk or Table - Base Frame Only - Sit to Standing Desk Computer Workstation - Modern and Ergonomic](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005MR5YA2/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - the hand-crank adjustable desk frame.  Total: $518,  shipped to my door.
 * [Weslo Cadence G 5.9 Treadmill](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Weslo-Cadence-G-5.9-Treadmill/14972088) - ordered from Wal-Mart, picked up at a store.  Total: $304, including tax.
 * Big 7 foot by 3 foot black IKEA table top from Habitat for Humanity ReStore.  Total: $24, incl. tax.

**Grand total: $846**  Not too shabby, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out (see pictures below).

For the treadmill, I took off the arms, and fished out the cable from the treadmill to the console so I could run it separately.  
I disconnected the small active part of the console from the huge and crazy-ass plastic frame it lives in.  I just put it in the desk,
though I might get fancier with it eventually.  It's working well enough at the moment.

The desk I assembled according to instructions (I went as wide as it would go, to give plenty of treadmill room and to
provide the widest possible base for the desk top).  I just plopped the desk top onto the frame and cranked it up high
enough to walk and type.  :tada:

Not included in the bill of sale, I guess... We have a number of block-printed textiles from our trips to India, 
including some [Ajrakh](http://www.thehindu.com/arts/crafts/ajrakh-printing/article3981585.ece) cloths.  
I put one of them on top as a desk cover, which makes everything so much prettier (lots of Ajrakh pictures [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=ajrakh&tbm=isch)).

### Closing thoughts

How am I liking it?  Great, so far (it's been about 45 minutes).  I put this page together while walking on the treadmill, walking at 1.5mph.  Seems legit.  :metal: :walking:
